# `bitcask` Module - Mini Bitcask


The `bitcask` module is the core implementation of the Bitcask key-value storage engine. It provides efficient, durable, and straightforward data storage for single-node environments, acting as the foundation for the `mini_bitcask` project.


## Features

1. **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)**:
   - Ensures data durability by persisting changes to a log before applying them to storage.
   - Enables reliable recovery in case of system failure.

2. **In-Memory Indexing**:
   - Maintains a fast in-memory index mapping keys to their data locations on disk.
   - Optimized for efficient data retrieval with minimal disk I/O.

3. **Data Compaction**:
   - Implements a merge process to consolidate and reclaim disk space.
   - Removes outdated or deleted data for better storage efficiency.

4. **Concurrency Support**:
   - Allows concurrent read and write operations.
   - Ensures consistency and integrity with fine-grained locking mechanisms.

5. **Persistence**:
   - Guarantees that all data is stored durably on disk, even after crashes or restarts.



## Core Concepts

1. **Write-Ahead Logging**:
   - All write operations are appended to a log file before being committed to ensure durability.
   - Facilitates recovery of data during unexpected crashes or restarts.

2. **Compaction**:
   - Periodically merges multiple log files into a single file.
   - Reclaims storage space by removing obsolete data (e.g., updated or deleted entries).

3. **In-Memory Index**:
   - Maintains a mapping of keys to their data locations on disk for fast lookups.
   - Reduces the need for repeated file scans during read operations.

4. **Concurrency**:
   - Provides thread-safe read and write operations.
   - Uses fine-grained locks to minimize contention.


## Future Enhancements

1. **Distributed Support**:
   - Extend the single-node implementation to support distributed deployments for scalability and fault tolerance.

2. **Advanced Indexing**:
   - Introduce more sophisticated data structures (e.g., LSM trees) for indexing.

3. **Improved Compaction**:
   - Optimize compaction algorithms to handle large datasets more efficiently.

4. **Monitoring and Metrics**:
   - Add tools for monitoring storage performance and space usage.
